for the user function....

1. our initial display in our user container should be "A user profile image"
2. onclick, "A Modal" with signup and Signin,
3. when someone signs in, their email should be displayed beside the user image, and then onclick should be "null"
4. so, our create context should com from the form, where we would get our user "EMAIL", 'ONCLICK EVENT'
